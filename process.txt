This is the process fro how OpenFace data is fully processed for core measurements:

1. Core data:
    1.1. You pass an openface data file
    1.2. the UMD extracts only the relevent information
    1.3. stores it as a parquet file as a universal measuremement data set. 

2. Anchor:
    2.1. Using the UMD set, we extract all points per frame 
    2.2. it also imports the anchor struct from UMD
    2.3. we take the average of every point in the frame to get the "center"
    2.4. we then push those values to the struct. 
    2.5. this struct is part of the CoreMeasurementUMD and is held in the memory

3. Centering:
    3.1. We extract the UMD set and anchor points per frame
    3.2. We then subtract the anchor from the UMD set which places all points around 0,0,0
    3.3. These values are pushed to the UMD Centered Landmark strut
    3.4. Which is part of the CoreMeasurementUMD which is held in the memory

4. Pose Correction:
    4.1. We extract the centered landmarks held in memory and the UMD Pose values
    4.2. We then apply those pose values to the landmarks to reverse head/point rotation
    4.3. We push these values to the UMD pose corrected landmark struct
    4.4. This struct is part of the CoreMeasurementUMD whic his held in memory



MAKE A GRAPH FEATURE LIKE PRAAT

Add this to the cargo.toml when we add the GUI stuff to the github
