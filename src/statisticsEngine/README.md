# STATISTICS ENGINE

Statistics!!!!! In this section of MOSAIC we start looking at statistical analysis of MOSAIC data and looking at how it interacts with speech. I will fill out this README as I add more things. 

## Representational Dissimilairty Matrix + Multidimensional Scaling
Because speech is so complicated and made up of several different features it can be hard to understand what features of the filter contribute to the sound produced. Using a Representational Dissimilairty Matrix (RDM) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). It will make 5 dimensions and use a scree plot to see which is the lowest stress.
