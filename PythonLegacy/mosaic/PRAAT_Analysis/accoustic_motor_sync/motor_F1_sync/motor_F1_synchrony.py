"""
correlational analysis between:
- Inner/Outer bio area
- Philtrum - bottom lip distance
- and jaw/tongue height (F1)

Measurements could mean:
F1 Rises could indicate mouth opening
Delayed F1 Rise could indicate a motor disorder
Rapid F1 rise could indicate stuttering onset

Very good for articulatory acoustic couppling/comparisons
