Compares transitions in things like OAS slopes (rate of asymmetric change), bio inner area and commissure angles with F2 spectral moments

We might expect

CAS could manifest as delayed coarticulation
Dysarthria could manifest as smoother and/or flatter transitions
Stuttering could present as abrupt and/or discontinuous transitions

Bascially measureing coordination
