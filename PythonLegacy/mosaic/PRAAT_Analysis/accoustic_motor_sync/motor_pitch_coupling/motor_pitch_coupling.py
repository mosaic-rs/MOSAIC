"""
Measures the synchrony between
- Commissure movement
- OAS Metrics (magnitude of asymmetry)
- Pitch (F0)

Could show
in emotional or speech with more emphasis there is a stronger "coupling"
In monotone speech there could be less coupling
We could maybe see how this affects tremor like disorders

Great for detecting suprasegmental dysfunction.
